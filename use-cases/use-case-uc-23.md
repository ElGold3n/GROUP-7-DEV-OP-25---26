USE CASE: UC-23 GitFlow Branching

CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION  
Goal in Context  
As a Maintainer, I want to enforce GitFlow branching so that development is structured and traceable.

Scope  
Project Governance.

Level  
System-level task.

Preconditions
- Repository initialized.
- Branch protection rules defined.

Success End Condition  
Branches follow GitFlow: master, develop, feature, release.

Failed End Condition  
Commits bypass branching rules.

Primary Actor  
Maintainer.

Trigger  
Contributor attempts to push or merge.

MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO
1. Maintainer defines branch rules.
2. Contributors create feature branches.
3. Features merge into develop.
4. Releases branch from develop.
5. Master updated only from release.

EXTENSIONS
- Contributor pushes directly to master: system blocks.
- Merge conflict: contributor resolves before merge.

SUB-VARIATIONS  
None.

SCHEDULE  
DUE DATE: Release 1.0
