## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Instead, please report it privately to the maintainers.

2. **How to report:**  
   - Send an email to the Group7 maintainers at:  
     `K.Sim@napier.ac.uk`  
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.

3. **Response expectations:**  
   - You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours**.  
   - We will provide updates on the investigation within **7 days**.  
   - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and release a patched version as soon as possible.  
   - If the report is declined (e.g., not a security issue), we will explain why.

4. **Disclosure policy:**  
   - Please allow us time to patch before publicly disclosing the vulnerability.  
   - Once a fix is released, we will credit the reporter (if desired) in the changelog.
